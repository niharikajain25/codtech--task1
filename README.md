objective:
Redesign the DirecTrac landing page to improve usability, aesthetics, and conversion rates.

Before:
The original landing page featured a dark color scheme, dense text blocks, and a cluttered layout. Navigation was heavy, the call-to-action buttons lacked contrast, and there was minimal social proof to build trust.

Redesign Strategy:
I applied a clean, light color palette with blue accents to create a modern and approachable look. The hero section was redesigned with a larger headline, simplified copy, and a prominent “Get Started” CTA button. Illustrations were updated to show the product across desktop and mobile for a more contemporary feel. The navigation was streamlined to reduce friction, and a testimonials section was added to highlight customer satisfaction.

Results:

Increased clarity of the product value proposition.

Stronger visual hierarchy for better scanability.

Higher perceived trustworthiness through social proof.

More visually appealing and conversion-focused CTA placement.

Key Improvements:

Modern, responsive layout with more whitespace.

Harmonized typography and iconography.

Simplified user journey and improved CTA visibility.
